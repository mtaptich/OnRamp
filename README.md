      VUDlab will be hosting an event to get people started making data visualizations using D3.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our "On Ramp for d3.js" is designed to get people across disciplines the needed tools and know-how to create simple and easy-to-manipulate data visualizations.  By the end of the night, we plan to have our participants complete two web-based visualizations and get the baseline tools needed to begin learning d3.js on a more serious level.  Think of our event as your first crash course in creating interactive tools to show off your work!  We will be providing food and soft drinks for everyone (don't worry... we got you).
